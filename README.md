# MagPy
A Python toolbox for controlling Magstim TMS stimulators via serial communication.

Check the Wiki (https://github.com/nicolasmcnair/magpy/wiki) for details on how use MagPy.

N.B. Currently Magpy supports Rapid Magstim stimulators with software version 5. I am currently working on a version which will support software versions up to 10, which should be released shortly.
